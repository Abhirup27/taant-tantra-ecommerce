## Taant Tantra App 
 This is a monorepo containing all the services.

### Technologies
 - Valkey
 - localstack (for local S3 compliant storage testing) / DigitalOcean Spaces for prod.
 - OpenSearch (for complex product search queries) / SQL queries for simple search queries.
 - For the database I went with Supabase (PostgreSQL).
 - For the back-end I aim to write most of the code using composition, closures and not through object prototype chain/ inheritance.
 - For testing I will either use vitest or jest.
 
 NOTE: All the assets currently present in the front-end's source have not been used publicly or commercially.
